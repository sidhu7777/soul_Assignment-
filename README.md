# License Plate Recognition (LPR) Project

This project focuses on detecting and recognizing vehicle license plates from images. It involves two distinct tasks:

1. **License Plate Detection**: Identifying and locating the license plates in the given images.
2. **License Plate Character Recognition**: Deciphering the alphanumeric characters inscribed on the detected license plates.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of two main sets for training and testing the model:

### 1. **Training Set 1 (Detection)**:
   - **Size**: 900 images
   - **Description**: Each image contains a single car with its license plate. The annotations provide the coordinates of a bounding box (ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax) that encapsulates the license plate.
   
### 2. **Training Set 2 (Character Recognition)**:
   - **Size**: 900 images
   - **Description**: This set contains images of license plates only. The annotations contain the alphanumeric text present on each license plate.

### 3. **Test Set**:
   - **Size**: 201 images
   - **Description**: The test set is similar to the first training set, containing images with vehicles and their license plates. The task is twofold: detect the license plates and recognize the characters on them.

## Project Workflow

### Step 1: License Plate Detection
   - **Goal**: Detect and locate the license plates within vehicle images.
   - **Approach**: Use an object detection model such as YOLO, Faster R-CNN, or SSD to predict bounding boxes around the license plates in the images.

### Step 2: License Plate Character Recognition
   - **Goal**: Recognize the alphanumeric characters on the detected license plates.
   - **Approach**: Use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques like Tesseract, or deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for text recognition.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `tensorflow` or `pytorch` for deep learning
  - `opencv-python` for image processing
  - `matplotlib` for visualizing the results
  - `tesseract` (optional) for OCR-based character recognition
  - `numpy` and `pandas` for data manipulation
